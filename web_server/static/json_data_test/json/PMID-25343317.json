PubMed search was performed in the period between 2002 and 2012. Studies qualified for the inclusion should have \u22655 years followed-up and reported the incidence of peri-implantitis and/or implant survival and/or MBL in patients with and without a history of periodontitis. A meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model on the selected qualified articles. All the 14 studies showed better implant survival rates for non-periodontitis patients' group.
