    "abstract": "Step-wise reduction in loading protocols is necessary to evaluate early loading of implants with mandibular overdentures. To compare the success rates of two different dental implant systems following conventional or early loading protocols in patients being rehabilitated with mandibular overdentures. Forty-eight edentulous participants were randomly allocated to two different implant systems: one with a machined titanium implant surface (Sterioss, Nobel Biocare, Yorba Linda, California, USA) and the other with a roughened titanium surface (Southern Implants, Irene, South Africa). For each system, the participants were further divided into control groups, in whom mandibular implant overdentures and their respective matrices were inserted following a standard 12-week healing period, and test groups, in whom a 6-week healing period was followed prior to identical loading. Two unsplinted implants to support implant overdentures were placed in the anterior mandible of all participants, using a standardized one-stage surgical procedure. Mobility tests and marginal bone levels, as well as peri-implant parameters, were evaluated at each baseline and 52 and 104 weeks after surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in the success rates of the two systems in either control or test groups. At the 2-year evaluation, a success rate was found of 87.5% and 70.8% for the control and test Sterioss groups, respectively, and 83.3% and 100% for the control and test Southern Implants groups were observed. For the Sterioss groups, eight implants were lost at an early stage: seven in the test group and one in the control group. For the Southern Implants control and test groups, no failures were seen at any time interval. There were no significant differences in marginal bone loss, Periotest values, and peri-implant parameters between implant systems or between any of the control or test groups. Early loading, with step-wise reductions in loading protocols, of unsplinted machined Sterioss and roughened Southern Implants fixtures with mandibular overdentures is possible for up to 2 years.",

    "abstract_prep": "Step-wise reduction in loading protocols is necessary to evaluate early loading of implants with mandibular overdentures. To compare the success rates of two different dental implant systems following conventional or early loading protocols in patients being rehabilitated with mandibular overdentures. Forty-eight edentulous participants were randomly allocated to two different implant systems: one with a machined titanium implant surface (Sterioss, Nobel Biocare, Yorba Linda, California, USA) and the other with a roughened titanium surface (Southern Implants, Irene, South Africa). For each system, the participants were further divided into control groups, in whom mandibular implant overdentures and their respective matrices were inserted following a standard 12-week healing period, and test groups, in whom a 6-week healing period was followed prior to identical loading. Two unsplinted implants to support implant overdentures were placed in the anterior mandible of all participants, using a standardized one-stage surgical procedure. Mobility tests and marginal bone levels, as well as peri-implant parameters, were evaluated at each baseline and 52 and 104 weeks after surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in the success rates of the two systems in either control or test groups. At the 2-year evaluation, a success rate was found of 87.5% and 70.8% for the control and test Sterioss groups, respectively, and 83.3% and 100% for the control and test Southern Implants groups were observed. For the Sterioss groups, eight implants were lost at an early stage: seven in the test group and one in the control group. For the Southern Implants control and test groups, no failures were seen at any time interval. There were no significant differences in marginal bone loss, Periotest values, and peri-implant parameters between implant systems or between any of the control or test groups. Early loading, with step-wise reductions in loading protocols, of unsplinted machined Sterioss and roughened Southern Implants fixtures with mandibular overdentures is possible for up to 2 years.",
