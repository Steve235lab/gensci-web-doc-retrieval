    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the contamination and the survival rate of periodontopathic and cariogenic species on new toothbrushes with antibacterial properties (coated bristles with triclosan), after a single use in periodontitis patients. The decontamination effect of the use of toothpaste was also evaluated. Ten patients, who consulted the Department of Periodontology, for treatment of chronic periodontitis, were selected. In each patient four different toothbrushes were used. Two quadrants, randomly selected, were each brushed using a different antibacterial toothbrush. In one of these two quadrants toothpaste was used. The same happened with the remaining quadrants, only with regular toothbrushes. After brushing, the toothbrushes were rinsed and stored in room temperature and a dry environment. After 0, 4 and 24h, four tufts, from each toothbrush, were cut and processed for selective and non-selective culturing techniques, followed by identification and quantification of all species found. Immediately after brushing the toothbrushes harbored a significant number of microorganisms, with no statistically significant difference between the two types of brushes (regular and antibacterial). The reduction of microorganisms from 0 to 4h after brushing was statistically significant (p<0.05). The difference was less obvious from 4 to 24h. When toothpaste was used, brushes harbored significantly (p<0.05) lower numbers of colony-forming units (CFU) compared to those without the use of toothpaste. The antibacterial toothbrush with triclosan coated tufts failed to limit the bacterial contamination. The toothpaste, on the other hand, significantly reduced the contamination of toothbrushes.",

    "abstract_prep": "The aim of this study was to examine the contamination and the survival rate of periodontopathic and cariogenic species on new toothbrushes with antibacterial properties (coated bristles with triclosan), after a single use in periodontitis patients. The decontamination effect of the use of toothpaste was also evaluated. Ten patients, who consulted the Department of Periodontology, for treatment of chronic periodontitis, were selected. In each patient four different toothbrushes were used. Two quadrants, randomly selected, were each brushed using a different antibacterial toothbrush. In one of these two quadrants toothpaste was used. The same happened with the remaining quadrants, only with regular toothbrushes. After brushing, the toothbrushes were rinsed and stored in room temperature and a dry environment. After 0, 4 and 24h, four tufts, from each toothbrush, were cut and processed for selective and non-selective culturing techniques, followed by identification and quantification of all species found. Immediately after brushing the toothbrushes harbored a significant number of microorganisms, with no statistically significant difference between the two types of brushes (regular and antibacterial). The reduction of microorganisms from 0 to 4h after brushing was statistically significant (p<0.05). The difference was less obvious from 4 to 24h. When toothpaste was used, brushes harbored significantly (p<0.05) lower numbers of colony-forming units (colony-forming units) compared to those without the use of toothpaste. The antibacterial toothbrush with triclosan coated tufts failed to limit the bacterial contamination. The toothpaste, on the other hand, significantly reduced the contamination of toothbrushes.",
