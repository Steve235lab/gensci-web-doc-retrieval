    "abstract": "This study clinically evaluates the treatment outcome of coronally positioned flap (CPF) associated with anorganic bone mineral/peptide-15 (ABM/P-15) in terms of root coverage and gain in clinical attachment level (CAL) and bone height (BH) in isolated Class I gingival recession (GR) defects. Fifteen healthy subjects with bilateral and comparable Miller Class I GR defects were selected. The defects were randomly assigned either to the test group (CPF with ABM/P-15) or to the control group (CPF only). Six months after surgery, a reduction in GR was observed in the test and control groups (2.20 \u00b1 0.54 and 2.40 \u00b1 0.80 mm, respectively; P <0.001) with no intergroup difference (P = 0.33). Complete root coverage was obtained in 10 and 11 defects in the test and control groups, respectively. In the test group 85.56% \u00b1 21.69% and in the control group 90.00% \u00b1 18.42% of the exposed root was covered. Although not clinically significant, a statistically greater increase in the gingival thickness was observed in the test group (0.03 mm; P = 0.01). CAL gain was significant in both groups (test group, 1.93 \u00b1 0.44 mm; control group, 2.13 \u00b1 1.15 mm; P <0.001) with no intergroup difference (P = 0.42). Intergroup and intragroup differences in width of keratinized tissue and BH were not significant (P \u22650.16). In the test group, a positive correlation was observed between BH at baseline and the reduction in GR (r = 0.56; P = 0.03). In isolated Class I GR defects, CPF associated with ABM/P-15 provided no significant difference in root coverage and CAL gain compared to CPF alone. In the ABM/P-15 group, a greater reduction in GR was associated with higher bone level at baseline.",

Fifteen healthy subjects with bilateral and comparable Miller Class I isolated Class I gingival recession defects were selected. The defects were randomly assigned either to the test group (coronally positioned flap with ABM/P-15) or to the control group (coronally positioned flap only). Six months after surgery, a reduction in isolated Class I gingival recession was observed in the test and control groups (2.20 \u00b1 0.54 and 2.40 \u00b1 0.80 mm, respectively; P <0.001) with no intergroup difference (P = 0.33). Complete root coverage was obtained in 10 and 11 defects in the test and control groups, respectively. In the test group 85.56% \u00b1 21.69% and in the control group 90.00% \u00b1 18.42% of the exposed root was covered. Although not clinically significant, a statistically greater increase in the gingival thickness was observed in the test group (0.03 mm; P = 0.01). clinical attachment level gain was significant in both groups (test group, 1.93 \u00b1 0.44 mm; control group, 2.13 \u00b1 1.15 mm; P <0.001) with no intergroup difference (P = 0.42). Intergroup and intragroup differences in width of keratinized tissue and BH were not significant (P \u22650.16). In the test group, a positive correlation was observed between BH at baseline and the reduction in isolated Class I gingival recession (r = 0.56; P = 0.03). In isolated Class I isolated Class I gingival recession defects, coronally positioned flap associated with ABM/P-15 provided no significant difference in root coverage and clinical attachment level gain compared to coronally positioned flap alone. In the ABM/P-15 group, a greater reduction in isolated Class I gingival recession was associated with higher bone level at baseline.",
