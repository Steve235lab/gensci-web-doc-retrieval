    "abstract": "Class II furcations present difficult treatment problems. Several treatment approaches to obtain furcation fill have been used with varying success. The response of mandibular Class II furcations to treatment with either a microporous biocompatible composite of PMMA (poly-methyl-methacrylate), PHEMA (poly-hydroxyl-ethyl methacrylate) and calcium hydroxide graft synthetic bone (HTR) replacement graft material; ePTFE barrier membrane; or a combination of the two was evaluated in trios of mandibular molars with Class II furcations in 8 patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis. Following initial preparation, full-thickness flaps were raised in the areas being treated, the bone and furcation defects debrided of granulomatous tissue, and the involved root surfaces mechanically prepared and chemically conditioned. By random allocation, HTR, ePTFE, or a combination of both was placed into and/or fitted over the furcations, packed and/or secured in place, and the host flap replaced or coronally positioned with sutures. Postsurgical deplaquing was performed every 10 days leading up to ePTFE removal at approximately 6 weeks. Continuing periodontal maintenance therapy was provided until surgical reentry at 6 months for documentation and any further necessary treatment. Direct clinical measurements demonstrated essentially similar clinical results with all 3 treatments for bone and soft tissue changes. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences except for better horizontal amount and percent defect fill with HTR alone. Four of 8 furcations became Class I clinically with HTR alone, 5 of 8 became Class I with ePTFE alone, and 5 of 8 with combination treatment. The only complete furcation closure occurred with HTR. The findings of this study suggest essentially equal clinical results with HTR bone replacement graft material alone, ePTFE barrier alone, and a combination of the two in mandibular molar Class II furcations. However, a real difference may not have been detected based on the small number of subjects in the study.",

    "abstract_prep": "Class II furcations present difficult treatment problems. Several treatment approaches to obtain furcation fill have been used with varying success. The response of mandibular Class II furcations to treatment with either a microporous biocompatible composite of PMMA (poly-methyl-methacrylate), PHEMA (poly-hydroxyl-ethyl methacrylate) and calcium hydroxide graft synthetic bone (hydroxide graft synthetic bone) replacement graft material; ePTFE barrier membrane; or a combination of the two was evaluated in trios of mandibular molars with Class II furcations in 8 patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis. Following initial preparation, full-thickness flaps were raised in the areas being treated, the bone and furcation defects debrided of granulomatous tissue, and the involved root surfaces mechanically prepared and chemically conditioned. By random allocation, hydroxide graft synthetic bone, ePTFE, or a combination of both was placed into and/or fitted over the furcations, packed and/or secured in place, and the host flap replaced or coronally positioned with sutures. Postsurgical deplaquing was performed every 10 days leading up to ePTFE removal at approximately 6 weeks. Continuing periodontal maintenance therapy was provided until surgical reentry at 6 months for documentation and any further necessary treatment. Direct clinical measurements demonstrated essentially similar clinical results with all 3 treatments for bone and soft tissue changes. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences except for better horizontal amount and percent defect fill with hydroxide graft synthetic bone alone. Four of 8 furcations became Class I clinically with hydroxide graft synthetic bone alone, 5 of 8 became Class I with ePTFE alone, and 5 of 8 with combination treatment. The only complete furcation closure occurred with hydroxide graft synthetic bone. The findings of this study suggest essentially equal clinical results with hydroxide graft synthetic bone bone replacement graft material alone, ePTFE barrier alone, and a combination of the two in mandibular molar Class II furcations. However, a real difference may not have been detected based on the small number of subjects in the study.",
