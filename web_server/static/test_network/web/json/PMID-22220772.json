    "abstract": "The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the adjunctive clinical effects of the systemic administration of ornidazole (ORN) in the full-mouth scaling and root planing (SRP) of individuals with moderate-to-advanced chronic periodontitis. Fifty-eight individuals presenting \u226512 teeth with probing depth (PD) \u22654 mm were selected. All participants were instructed on strict oral hygiene measures and were advised to use 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash for 1 week before being allocated to two groups. Thirty participants were randomly assigned to full-mouth SRP + placebo (control group), and 28 participants were assigned to full-mouth SRP + ORN (test group). The clinical outcomes evaluated were plaque index, gingival index, clinical attachment level (CAL), and PD. Fifty participants could be evaluated by \u22646 months. At 6 months, the test group had greater mean reduction (2.84 mm) in PD compared to the control group (0.84 mm) (P <0.05), and there was also a greater mean CAL reduction (2.92 mm) in the test group compared to the control group (0.92 mm) (P <0.05). The systemic use of ORN, when used in conjunction with initial periodontal treatment consisting of SRP in adults with periodontitis, achieves significantly better clinical results than initial periodontal treatment alone.",

    "abstract_prep": "The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the adjunctive clinical effects of the systemic administration of ornidazole (ornidazole) in the full-mouth scaling and root planing (root planing) of individuals with moderate-to-advanced chronic periodontitis. Fifty-eight individuals presenting \u226512 teeth with probing depth (PD) \u22654 mm were selected. All participants were instructed on strict oral hygiene measures and were advised to use 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash for 1 week before being allocated to two groups. Thirty participants were randomly assigned to full-mouth root planing + placebo (control group), and 28 participants were assigned to full-mouth root planing + ornidazole (test group). The clinical outcomes evaluated were plaque index, gingival index, clinical attachment level (clinical attachment level), and PD. Fifty participants could be evaluated by \u22646 months. At 6 months, the test group had greater mean reduction (2.84 mm) in PD compared to the control group (0.84 mm) (P <0.05), and there was also a greater mean clinical attachment level reduction (2.92 mm) in the test group compared to the control group (0.92 mm) (P <0.05). The systemic use of ornidazole, when used in conjunction with initial periodontal treatment consisting of root planing in adults with periodontitis, achieves significantly better clinical results than initial periodontal treatment alone.",
