dsm - 5	bacteria_to_disease	irritability	1	0	27344135	PMID:27344135; Original text:One long-term, placebo discontinuation study found that relapse rates did not differ between children/adolescents randomised to continue aripiprazole versus children/adolescents randomised to receive placebo, suggesting that re-evaluation of aripiprazole use after a period of stabilisation in irritability symptoms is warranted.
