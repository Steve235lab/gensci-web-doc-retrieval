homocysteine	nutrient_to_mechanism	methionine synthase	1	1.0	24676906	PMID:24676906; Original text:The serum level of glutathione in autistic subjects was significantly below control levels, while levels of homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine were elevated, indicative of oxidative stress and decreased methionine synthase activity.
folate	nutrient_to_mechanism	folate receptor alpha	1	1.281	32892962	PMID:32892962; Original text:Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with disorder, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies.
