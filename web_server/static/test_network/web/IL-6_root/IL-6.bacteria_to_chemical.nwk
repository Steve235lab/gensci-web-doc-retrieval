dsm - 5	bacteria_to_chemical	aripiprazole	1	1.0	27344135	PMID:27344135; Original text:One long-term, placebo discontinuation study found that relapse rates did not differ between children/adolescents randomised to continue aripiprazole versus children/adolescents randomised to receive placebo, suggesting that re-evaluation of aripiprazole use after a period of stabilisation in irritability symptoms is warranted.
desulfovibrio	bacteria_to_chemical	p-cresol sulfate	1	4.282	33087514	PMID:33087514; Original text:Although not statistically significant, p-cresol sulfate was relatively higher in the disorder group at baseline, and after Microbiota transfer therapy, the levels decreased and were similar to levels in typically developing (TD) controls.
