    "abstract": "The aim was to evaluate the effects of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (rhFGF-2) on treating periodontal intra-bony defects, compared to the control (carrier alone). Electronic and hand searches were performed to identify eligible studies. The weighed mean differences of linear defect fill (LDF), probing depth (PD) reduction, clinical attachment level (CAL) gain and gingival recession (GR) were calculated using random effect meta-analysis. The searches yielded 1018 articles, of which seven studies were included. Only one included study was considered at low risk of bias. The outcomes that reached statistical significance in comparison to carriers alone included: LDF (0.95 mm, 95% CI: 0.62-1.28 mm or 20.17%, 95% CI: 11.81-28.54%) and CAL gain (0.34 mm, 95% CI: 0.03-0.65 mm) for PDGF, and LDF (21.22%, 95% CI: 5.82-36.61%) for FGF-2. Within the limits of this review, rhPDGF-BB demonstrated significantly more LDF and CAL gain; rhFGF-2 resulted in significantly higher percentage of LDF.",

    "abstract_prep": "The aim was to evaluate the effects of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (rhFGF-2) on treating periodontal intra-bony defects, compared to the control (carrier alone). Electronic and hand searches were performed to identify eligible studies. The weighed mean differences of linear defect fill (linear defect fill), probing depth (PD) reduction, clinical attachment level (CAL) gain and gingival recession (gingival recession) were calculated using random effect meta-analysis. The searches yielded 1018 articles, of which seven studies were included. Only one included study was considered at low risk of bias. The outcomes that reached statistical significance in comparison to carriers alone included: linear defect fill (0.95 mm, 95% CI: 0.62-1.28 mm or 20.17%, 95% CI: 11.81-28.54%) and CAL gain (0.34 mm, 95% CI: 0.03-0.65 mm) for PDGF, and linear defect fill (21.22%, 95% CI: 5.82-36.61%) for FGF-2. Within the limits of this review, rhPDGF-BB demonstrated significantly more linear defect fill and CAL gain; rhFGF-2 resulted in significantly higher percentage of linear defect fill.",
