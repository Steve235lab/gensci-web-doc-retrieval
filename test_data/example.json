      "Abstract": "This study <span style=\"color:red\">aimed</span> to evaluate clinical and microbiological effects of systemic azithromycin ( AZM ) in adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal therapy ( NSPT ; or scaling root planing - SRP ) in treatment of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans associated periodontitis ( AAAP ) . Seventy individuals with moderate to severe periodontitis and subgingival detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans were randomly allocated to two groups . Thirty-five individuals were allocated to full mouth SRP+AZM ( 500 mg oral delivery ( OD ) × 3 days ) while 35 individuals were allocated to SRP+Placebo ( OD × 3 days ) group . The clinical variables evaluated were probing depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , gingival index ( GI ) , plaque index ( PI ) , and percent bleeding on probing sites ( % BOP ) , while microbiologic variables included percentage of subjects positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline , 3 , 6 , and 12 months . The AZM group showed statistically significant reduction in mean PD ( 2.91 ± 0.88 mm ) as compared to placebo ( 1.51 ± 0.98 mm ) ( P < 0.001 ) , while CAL gain was significant in the AZM group ( 2.71 ± 1.15 mm ) as compared to the placebo group ( 1.71 ± 1.29 mm ) ( P < 0.001 ) . There was also a statistically significant reduction in the number of subjects positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans in the AZM group ( P < 0.0001 ) . Azithromycin was found to significantly improve the clinical and microbiological parameters in AAAP individuals .",

      "Chinese_Abstract": "本研究旨在评价系统性阿奇霉素(AZM)辅助非手术牙周治疗(NSPT; 或洁治根刨- SRP)治疗放线菌聚集杆菌相关性牙周炎(AAAP)。 选取中重度牙周炎及龈下检出放线菌的患者70例，随机分为两组。 35人被分配到全口SRP+AZM (500 mg口服给药(OD) × 3天)组，35人被分配到SRP+安慰剂(OD)组。 评估的临床变量包括探测深度(PD)、临床附着水平(CAL)、牙龈指数(GI)、菌斑指数(PI)和探测部位出血百分比(%BOP)，而微生物变量包括受试者基线、3个月、6个月和12个月时放线菌阳性的百分比。 AZM组显示显著的减少意味着PD(2.91±0.88毫米)相比安慰剂(1.51±0.98毫米)(P < 0.001),而卡尔增幅显著AZM组(2.71±1.15毫米)相比安慰剂组(1.71±1.29毫米)(P < 0.001)。 AZM组中放线菌阳性的受试者数量也有统计学意义上的减少(P < 0.0001)。 阿奇霉素被发现能显著改善AAAP个体的临床和微生物参数。",
