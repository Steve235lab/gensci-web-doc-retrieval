      "Abstract": "This study <span style=\"color:red\">aimed</span> to evaluate clinical and microbiological effects of systemic azithromycin ( AZM ) in adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal therapy ( NSPT ; or scaling root planing - SRP ) in treatment of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans associated periodontitis ( AAAP ) . Seventy individuals with moderate to severe periodontitis and subgingival detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans were randomly allocated to two groups . Thirty-five individuals were allocated to full mouth SRP+AZM ( 500 mg oral delivery ( OD ) × 3 days ) while 35 individuals were allocated to SRP+Placebo ( OD × 3 days ) group . The clinical variables evaluated were probing depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , gingival index ( GI ) , plaque index ( PI ) , and percent bleeding on probing sites ( % BOP ) , while microbiologic variables included percentage of subjects positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline , 3 , 6 , and 12 months . The AZM group showed statistically significant reduction in mean PD ( 2.91 ± 0.88 mm ) as compared to placebo ( 1.51 ± 0.98 mm ) ( P < 0.001 ) , while CAL gain was significant in the AZM group ( 2.71 ± 1.15 mm ) as compared to the placebo group ( 1.71 ± 1.29 mm ) ( P < 0.001 ) . There was also a statistically significant reduction in the number of subjects positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans in the AZM group ( P < 0.0001 ) .
