<div>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment on <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #008000;">hemoglobinA1c </span>( <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #008000;">HbA1c </span>) levels , oxidative stress balance and quality of life ( life ) in patients with <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">type </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">2 </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">diabetes </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">mellitus </span>( type 2 diabetes mellitus ) compared to no periodontal treatment ( simple oral hygiene instructions only ) . The design was a 6-month , single-masked , single <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: purple;">center </span>, randomized clinical trial . Patients had both <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">type </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">2 </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">diabetes </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">mellitus </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">chronic </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">periodontitis </span>. Forty participants were enrolled between April 2014 and March 2016 at the Nephrology , Diabetology and Endocrinology Department of Okayama University Hospital . The periodontal treatment <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: purple;">group </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: purple;">( </span>n = 20 ) received non-surgical periodontal therapy <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: purple;">, </span>including scaling <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: purple;">and </span>root planing plus oral hygiene instructions , and consecutive supportive periodontal therapy at 3 and 6 months . The control <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: purple;">group </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: purple;">( </span>n = 17 ) received only oral hygiene instructions without treatment during the experimental period . The primary study outcome was the change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 3 months . Secondary outcomes included changes in oxidative stress balance ( oxidative stress balance ) , the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">Diabetes </span>Therapy-Related life and clinical periodontal parameters from baseline to 3 months and baseline to 6 months . Changes in HbA1c in the periodontal treatment group were not significantly different with those in the control group at 3 and 6 months . Systemic oxidative stress balance and life significantly improved in the periodontal treatment group compared to the control group at 3 months . In the subgroup analysis ( moderately poor control of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">diabetes </span>) , the decrease in HbA1c levels in the periodontal treatment group was greater than that in the control group at 3 months but not significant . In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">type </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">2 </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">diabetes </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000080;">mellitus </span>patients <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: purple;">, </span>non-surgical periodontal treatment improved systemic oxidative stress balance and life , but did not decrease HbA1c levels at 3 months follow-up .
